# 🚀 IntelliSOC – Smart Cyber Threat Detection System (Mini SIEM)

IntelliSOC is a full-stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system designed to monitor, analyze, and detect cyber threats in real-time. It processes system logs, correlates events, and provides actionable insights through an intuitive and interactive dashboard.
The system focuses on identifying suspicious activities such as brute-force attacks, failed login attempts, and anomalous behavior patterns using rule-based and intelligent detection techniques.

---

## ⚠️ Problem

Modern systems generate massive volumes of logs, but analyzing them manually is:

* ⏳ Time-consuming
* ❌ Error-prone
* 🚫 Inefficient for real-time threat detection

Security teams need automated systems to quickly identify threats and reduce manual workload.

---

## 💡 Solution

IntelliSOC automates log analysis by:

* 🔍 Detecting cyber attacks instantly
* 🔗 Correlating multiple events to uncover real threats
* 🧠 Providing clear, explainable insights

It simulates a real-world SIEM system used in enterprise cybersecurity environments.

---

## 🎬 Demo Flow

1. Upload a `.log` file
2. System parses and structures logs
3. Detects threats like brute force & account compromise
4. Correlates events and assigns risk scores
5. Displays results in an interactive dashboard
6. Export results as CSV for further analysis

---

## 💡 Key Differentiators

* 🔍 **Explainable Alerts** – clear reasoning behind every detection
* ⏱️ **Time-Based Behavioral Analysis**
* 📊 **Session-Based Log Isolation**
* ⚡ **Lightweight SIEM Simulation** (fast & deployable)

---

## 🚀 Features

* **File Ingestion:** Upload `.log` files directly
* **Parsing Engine:** Converts raw logs → structured JSON
* **Threat Detection Engine:**

  * Brute Force Attack detection
  * Suspicious multi-user IP activity
* **Correlation Engine:** Detects account compromise patterns
* **Time-Based Logic & Aggregation:** Focuses on recent events and avoids duplicate alerts
* **Enrichment Layer:**

  * Risk scoring (0–100)
  * MITRE ATT&CK mapping
  * Human-readable explanations
* **Session Management:** Isolates each upload for clean analysis
* **Export Reports:** Download results as CSV
